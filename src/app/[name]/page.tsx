          When I first started coding, Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was my editor
          of choice. It's widely regarded as the industry standard, and I was
          more than satisfied with its performance, especially on my new laptop.
          I didnâ€™t feel it lacked anything crucial, and its speed was adequate
          for my needs. At that time, my focus was on improving my typing speed,
          aiming for over 150 words per minute (wpm), believing that faster
          typing equated to higher productivity. However, I often found myself
          relying heavily on the mouse for various tasks within VSCode, which I
          realized later was holding me back from reaching my full potential.

          Discovering Neovim

          One day, while browsing YouTube, I stumbled upon a channel called{" "}

          . I was mesmerized by the speed and efficiency with which he navigated
          his editor, which looked nothing like VSCode. I noticed he rarely used
          the mouse for tasks such as creating or switching files. Intrigued, I
          discovered that he was using Neovim. This revelation led me down a
          rabbit hole of Neovim tutorials and showcases, and I was thoroughly
          impressed. Motivated by what I saw, I decided to make the switch to
          Neovim.

          First Attempt: Big Mistake
        </h3>
        <p>
          My initial attempt to install Neovim directly on my laptop was a
          disaster. There's a common saying, "I don't know how to exit Vim,"
          which rang true for me. Coming from a VSCode background, I struggled
          to even exit Neovim, let alone use it effectively. I encountered
          numerous errors, and there was a lack of coding suggestions, which led
          to frustration. Consequently, I uninstalled Neovim. Despite this
          setback, I continued to watch ThePrimeAgen's videos, drawn by his
          speed and efficiency.

        <br />
        <p>
          As a relatively new coder, I was not understanding him but still
          continueed to watch his video becaused I was always impressed by his
          speed and efficiency. Inspired by him, I decided to incorporate Vim
          motions into my VSCode setup. I installed a Vim extension in VSCode
          and forced myself to learn Vim motions by selling my mouse to a
          friend. For almost a year, this hybrid setup worked well for me.
          However, as I customized VSCode further and used Vim commands for
          almost everything, I noticed a decline in performance. The lag became
          unbearable, prompting me to reconsider switching to Neovim.

          Successful Transition and Configuration
        </h3>
        <p>
          After so many unsuccessfull attempts, this time transition was
          smoother. After switching to Clang/LLVM as my C compiler, Neovim
          installed without any issues. I opted for {""}

          </a>{" "}
          to avoid the time-consuming task of writing my configuration from
          scratch. Then, I customized it with keymaps to suit my needs. Within a
          few days, I experienced a level of speed and efficiency that I had
          never felt with VSCode. Tasks like creating or deleting files, which
          used to lag in VSCode, were now seamless in Neovim. I may not be as
          fast as ThePrimeAgen, but I'm blazing through my work at my own pace.
